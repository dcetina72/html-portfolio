<h1>The Best Movies According to Danny</h1>
<h2>My top 5 movies of all-time, bitch.</h2>
<hr>

<h3>Kill Bill vol. 1 and 2</h3>
<p>Badass lady assassins, swords, kung fu, and vengeance. Yes, both films count as one.</p>

<h3>Hard Candy</h3>
<p>Elliot Page is astonishing in this provocative game of cat and mouse with a surprising twist.</p>

<h3>Kangaroo Jack</h3>
<p>It's probably the worst film on this list, but Jerry O'Connel was my sexual awakening here, so there you go.</p>

<h3>Turning Red</h3>
<p>Probably one of the funniest animated films I've seen in recent years. It hits my millennial heart so hard like a runaway dump truck.</p>

<h3>God's Own Country</h3>
<p>A haiku on why I love this film so much:
    <br />
    <br />This film is so gay 
    <br />Sad farmer meets hot new guy
    <br />And no one dies. Yay!
